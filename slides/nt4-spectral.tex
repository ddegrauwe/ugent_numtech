				\item periodic, wave-like\vfill
				\item they don't change (a lot) when taking the derivative:
					%
					\begin{align*}
						\frac{d}{dx}\sin k x&=k\cos k x\\
						\frac{d}{dx}\cos k x&=-k\sin k x\\
						\frac{d}{dx}\exp i k x&= i k \exp i k x

			%
			\begin{equation*}
				f(x_j)=\sum_{k=-K}^K\alpha_k\exp(i \, k \, x_j)
			\end{equation*}\vfill
			%
		\item To uniquely determine the coefficients $\alpha_k$, the number of gridpoints must be equal to the number of waves, i.e. $N=2K+1$, so $\Delta x=\pi/K$.\vfill
			%
		\item For a uniform grid spacing, the highest resolvable wave has wavenumber $K$, i.e. period $2\Delta x$. We call this the Nyquist wavenumber. Waves with higher wavenumbers will be aliased (see further).\vfill
			%
		\item Note that we now have information \emph{between} gridpoints !?

			\end{equation*}
			%
			(note the symmetry with the composition formula).\vfill
			%
		\item Efficient algorithms exist to perform the spectral decomposition (i.e. calculate the coefficients $\alpha_k$), or the spectral composition (i.e. determine the values $f(x_j)$ from the coefficients $\alpha_k$) in $O(N\log N)$ operations:\vfill

				\psi (x) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} \alpha_k e^{ik x}

			\begin{equation*}
				E = \sum_{\vert k \vert > K} i k \alpha_k e^{ikx}
			\end{equation*}\vfill
			%
		\item If the $p$-th order derivative is continuous and all the lower order derivatives are continuous, it's possible to show that
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				| \alpha_k | \le \frac{C}{\vert k \vert^p}

			%
			\begin{equation*}
				K\sim\frac{1}{\Delta x}
			\end{equation*}\vfill
			%
		\item So the error on the derivative is bound by

			\begin{equation*}

			with $\tilde C$ a finite constant.\vfill

			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\left| \frac{c \Delta t}{\Delta x} \right| \le \frac{1}{\pi}

	\frametitle{Nonlinearity}
	%
	\vfill\begin{itemize}
		\item Aliasing mainly poses problems when multiplying fields: let $\phi_1(x)=e^{i\,k_1 x}$ and $\phi_2(x)=e^{i\,k_2 x}$. Then
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\phi_1(x) \phi_2(x) = e^{i(k_1+k_2) x}
			\end{equation*}\vfill
			%
		\item A multiplication of two fields changes the wavenumber. If $|k_1+k_2|>K$, aliasing will occur.
	\end{itemize}\vfill
	%
\end{frame}
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\begin{frame}
	%
	\frametitle{Nonlinearity}
	%
	\vfill\begin{itemize}
		\item Besides aliasing, there is an additional problem with nonlinearity in spectral space. Take, for instance, the advection equation with a nonconstant speed:
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\frac{\partial \phi(x,t)}{\partial t}+c(x,t)\frac{\partial \phi(x,t)}{\partial x}=0
			\end{equation*}
			%
			with
			%
			\begin{align*}
				 \phi(x,t) &= \sum_{k_1=-K}^K \hat\phi_{k_1} (t) e^{ik_1x}	&	c(x,t) &= \sum_{k_2=-K}^K \hat c_{k_2} (t) e^{ik_2x}
			\end{align*}\vfill
			%
		\item Then the equation for each wave component $\hat\phi_k(t)$ is:
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\frac{ d \hat\phi_{k}}{dt} + \sum_{\begin{array}{c} k_1+k_2=k \\ |k_1|,|k_2|\le K \end{array} } i\,k_1\,\hat c_{k_2}\,\hat\phi_{k_1} = 0
			\end{equation*}\vfill
			%
		\item In other words, one has to consider \emph{all possible combinations} of $k_1$ and $k_2$ that may contribute to each wave component.

%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\begin{frame}
	%
	\frametitle{Nonlinearity}
	%
	\vfill\begin{itemize}
		\item For instance, to write the equation for the spectral coefficient $\hat\phi_2$ of a wave with wavenumber $k=2$, one has to consider
			%
			\begin{itemize}
				\item $\hat c_0	\hat \phi_2$
				\item $\hat c_1 \hat\phi_1$
				\item $\hat c_2 \hat\phi_0$
				\item $\hat c_3 \hat\phi_{-1}$
				\item \ldots
			\end{itemize}\vfill
			%
		\item We say that multiplication is \emph{not local} in spectral space.\vfill
			%
\pause
		\item For a grid with $N$ gridpoints, this means that multiplication in spectral space takes $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ operations, while in gridpoint space, it only takes $\mathcal{O}(N)$ operations.

		\item Aliasing can be avoided by truncating the spectrum well before the Nyquist wavenumber $K$.\vfill
			%
		\item For example, let $k_{max}=K/2$, then a multiplication will produce fields with a maximal wavenumber $2k_{max}=K$, and no aliasing will occur.\vfill

				%
			\item The inversion of the differential operators like the Laplace operator $\nabla^2$ (see Dyn. Met.), which appears in \textbf{implicit schemes}.\vspace*{2ex}

				In gridpoint space, this requires the inversion of a HUGE $(n_xn_y)\times(n_xn_y)$ sparse matrix.

				\vspace*{2ex}\par
				In spectral space, this matrix becomes diagonal, and its inversion is trivial. This means \emph{implicit} time-integration schemes can be used much more easily.

		\item Davies' solution: apply the boundary conditions in a gentle way, i.e. through relaxation in the intermediate zone:
			%
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tikzpicture}[>=latex,y=15mm]
					\fill [blue!20] (0,0) rectangle (2,1) (6,1) rectangle (8,0);
					\draw[line width=1.5pt, blue] (0,0) .. controls (1,0) and (1,1) .. (2,1) -- (6,1) .. controls (7,1) and (7,0) .. (8,0);

					\draw[->] (0,-.2) -- (0,1.2) node [above left] {$\alpha$};
				\end{tikzpicture}
			\end{center}\vfill
			%
		\item Mathematically, the coupling looks like
			\begin{equation*}
				\psi=\alpha\tilde\psi+(1-\alpha)\psi_{LS}
			\end{equation*}
			%
			where $\tilde\psi$ is the solution with periodic boundary conditions, and $\psi_{LS}$ is the large-scale solution.\vfill
			%
		\item This coupling is done \emph{every time step}, but $\psi_{LS}$ is interpolated in time because of data limits (e.g. 3h).

	\frametitle{Use of a relaxation zone}
	%
	\vfill\begin{itemize}
		\item This strategy can also be derived mathematically by starting from a modified equation:
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} (x,t) + U \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} (x,t) = 
				- K(x) \left[ \psi (x,t) - \psi_{LS} (x,t) \right]
			\end{equation*}\vfill
			%
		\item The RHS represents a \emph{relaxation term} which penalizes differences (at the boundary) between the LAM solution $\psi$ and the large-scale solution $\psi_{LS}$. This scheme was proposed by Davies (1983).\vfill
			%
		\item The function $K(x)$ ultimately determines the relaxation function $\alpha(x)$.\vfill
			%
