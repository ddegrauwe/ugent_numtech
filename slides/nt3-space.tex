			\begin{equation*}
				\omega_{4c} = \frac{c}{\Delta x} \left( \frac43 \sin k \Delta x -    \frac16 \sin 2 k \Delta x \right)

	Stability is obtained if the imaginary part of $\omega$ is smaller than zero, i.e. if
	%
	\begin{equation*}
		\log\left(\left(1-\mu+\mu\cos k\Delta x\right)^2+\left(\mu\sin k\Delta x\right)^2\right) \leq 0
	\end{equation*}
	%
\pause
	This is equivalent to
	%
	\begin{equation*}
		\left(\left(1-\mu+\mu\cos k\Delta x\right)^2+\left(\mu\sin k\Delta x\right)^2\right) \leq 1
	\end{equation*}
	%
\pause
	Or
	\begin{equation*}
		\mu(1-\mu)(1-\cos k\Delta x) \leq 0
	\end{equation*}
	%
\pause
	Since $|\cos k\Delta x|\leq 1$, stability is guaranteed if
	%
	\begin{equation*}
		\mu(1-\mu) \leq 0
	\end{equation*}
	%
\pause
	Or if
	\begin{equation*}
		0\leq \mu\leq 1
	\end{equation*}
