	General remarks:
	%
	\begin{myitemize}{1ex}
		\item no course on Fortran or Linux; no course on complex algebra;\\ask for help!
		\item it's allowed to use Matlab, Python, R, etc. if you prefer this instead of Fortran;
		\item open assignment: no exact solution $+$ discussion is more important than results
		\item the purpose is you \emph{learn} something
		\item try to trigger strange/unwanted phenomena, and discuss solutions.
		\item you can propose a topic yourself.

	The linearized 1D shallow water equations (SWE) are given by:
	%
	\begin{align*}
		\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+U\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+g\frac{\partial h}{\partial x}&=0\\
		\frac{\partial h}{\partial t}+H\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+U\frac{\partial h}{\partial x}&=0
	\end{align*}
	%
	where $g$ is gravity, $U$ and $H$ are the constant basic-state velocity and water height, and $u(x,t)$ and $h(x,t)$ are the perturbations on the velocity and the water height.

		\item The barotropic vorticity equation BVE is given by:
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\frac{\partial \zeta}{\partial t}+\bm u\cdot\nabla\zeta=0
			\end{equation*}
			%
			where $\zeta$ is the vorticity, and $\bm u$ is the geostrophic wind, given by
			%
			\begin{align*}
				\bm u&=\bm k\times\nabla\psi		&		\nabla^2\psi&=\zeta
			\end{align*}
			%

			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\frac{\partial\nabla^2\psi}{\partial t}+J(\psi,\nabla^2\psi)=0
			\end{equation*}
			%
			where $J$ is the Jacobian operator:

	\frametitle{Original model}
	%
	The original (1950) model is characterized by:
	%
	\begin{myitemize}{1ex}
		\item a leapfrog time integration
			%
		\item second-order centered space differences
			%
		\item an expensive (pseudo-spectral) way to invert the Laplacian operator
			%
		\item heuristic boundary conditions:
			%
			\begin{myitemize}{1ex}
				\item $\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}=0$ on boundary
				\item $\frac{\partial \nabla^2 \psi}{\partial t}=0$ for entering fluid
			\end{myitemize}
			%
	\end{myitemize}
	Due to these boundary conditions and aliasing, the model is not stable.
	%
	\par\vspace*{4ex}
	The student's model is somewhat simplified:
	%
	\begin{myitemize}{1ex}
		\item Spectral inversion of Laplacian
		\item Periodic boundary conditions
		\item Coriolis effect removed
		\item Projection impact removed

	\frametitle{Getting started}
	
	\begin{myitemize}{3ex}
		\item Instead of working under Linux (previous years), we'll use a Jupyter notebook. Hopefully this is more student-friendly.
			%
		\item However, the actual model is still written in Fortran, but compiling, launching and reviewing results will be done from the Jupyter notebook.
			%
		\item To get started, take the following steps:\vspace*{2ex}
			%
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item login on the UGENT HPC infrastructure \texttt{https://login.hpc.ugent.be/}\vspace*{2ex}
				\item launch a Jupyter IPython Notebook (under Interactive Apps)\vspace*{2ex}
				\item \textbf{Make sure to use the following settings}:
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Set Cluster to `slaking'
						\item Choose an appropriate value for the Time (you will be kicked off the system after this time)
						\item Set IPython version to `7.15.0 foss 2020a Python 3.8.2'\vspace*{2ex}
					\end{itemize}
				\item Hit the `Launch' button at the bottom\vspace*{2ex}
				\item After a few minutes, you should be able to connect to your Jupyter job (under My Interactive Sessions)
			\end{enumerate}
	\end{myitemize}

	\frametitle{Getting started with the Jupyter notebook}
	%
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The previous steps should bring you to an interface like this\vspace*{2ex}
			%
			\begin{center}
				\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{jupyter_home}
			\end{center}\vspace*{3ex}
			%
		\item This is not yet the actual notebook, but it allows you to easily navigate between files/folders, and to create new notebooks, folders or files.

\end{frame}
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\begin{frame}
	%
	\frametitle{Getting started with the Jupyter notebook}
	%
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Since file/folder manipulation is easier in a Linux terminal window, launch a terminal (under New $\rightarrow$ Terminal).\vspace*{3ex}
		\item Create a new folder and copy the necessary files with\\[2ex]
			\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
				\texttt{mkdir project\_numtech}\\
				\texttt{cp -r /user/gent/407/vsc40744/ugent/projects/swe1D project\_numtech/}
			\end{minipage}\\[2ex]
			(replace \texttt{swe1D} with \texttt{barovort} if needed)\\
			You can close the terminal window now.\vspace*{3ex}
		\item Back in the Jupyter launch window, navigate to the folder you just created. When clicking a Fortran file, an editor will open so you can modify it.\vspace*{3ex}
		\item Finally, click on the file \texttt{swe1D.ipynb}. This will open the notebook where you can interactively launch experiments and review the results.

	\frametitle{Getting started with the Jupyter notebook}
	%
	\begin{myitemize}{2ex}
		\item A notebook is organized in `Cells' containing python code. The code in a cell is evaluated when hitting the Run button or pressing Ctrl-Enter.
			%
		\item The SWE notebook contains 4 cells:
			%
			\begin{itemize}
				\item A cell to load the necessary functions from the module in the python file \texttt{swe1D\_fun.py}\vspace*{1ex}
				\item A cell to launch the model and retrieve the results (more on this later)\vspace*{1ex}
				\item A cell to animate the water height in time\vspace*{1ex}
				\item A cell to plot the water height at the last timestep
			\end{itemize}
			%
		\item What actually happens in the second cell is the following:
			%
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item the function \texttt{run\_program} from is called from the \texttt{swe1D\_fun} module.\vspace*{1ex}
				\item this function in turn launches a Linux script \texttt{run.sh}\vspace*{1ex}
				\item this script in turn performs the compilation with \texttt{gfortran} and runs the program\vspace*{1ex}
				\item the program generates an output file \texttt{output.dat}\vspace*{1ex}
				\item the function \texttt{run\_program} reads the data from this output file and transforms it into numpy arrays, which can be easily plotted.\vspace*{1ex}
			\end{enumerate}
			%
			While this looks quite combersome, *in principle* it shouldn't be modified. Only the Fortran code itself and the postprocessing in Jupyter need modifications.\vspace*{1ex}
			%
			\par
			Should something look strange or unexpected (and it will!) don't hesitate to contact me!
