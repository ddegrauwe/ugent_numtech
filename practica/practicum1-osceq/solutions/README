Solutions for Oscillation Equation
==================================

See subdirectories for solutions of different schemes. The results for each scheme can be found in the output_*.pdf files.

Following behaviour is observed:


forward scheme

	unconditionally unstable; decelerating
	

backward scheme

	unconditionally stable; damping; decelerating (hard to see)
	
	
trapezium scheme

	neutral; decelerating
	
	
matsuno scheme
	
	conditionally stable : damping if KAPPA*DT<1; accelerating


leapfrog scheme

	conditionally stable : neutral if KAPPA*DT<1; accelerating


leapfrog_cm
	
	(leapfrog, but with ERROR in first timestep to trigger the computational mode)
	The error stays in the solution forever.


leapfrog_filter
	
	also with ERROR in the first timestep, but now the filter removes the error after a few timesteps.
	The scheme becomes damping instead of neutral.
