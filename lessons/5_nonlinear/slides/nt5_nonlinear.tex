	\begin{itemize}
		\item We consider here systems with multiple dependent variables plus interaction between these variables (e.g. wind-pressure).\\[4ex]
			%
		\item Example: the linearized 1D shallow water equations (SWE) with unknowns $u$ and $h$:
			%
			\begin{align*}
				\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + U \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + g \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} &= 0 \\
				\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} + U \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} + H \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} &= 0
			\end{align*}
			%
			with $U$ and $H$ constants.
			%
			\par\vspace*{2ex}
			These equations are used very often to study numerical schemes.

		\item In matrix notation:
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\frac{\partial \bm v}{\partial t}+\bm C\frac{\partial \bm v}{\partial x}=\bm 0
			\end{equation*}
			%
			where $\bm v$ is a vector containing the unknown fields
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\bm v=\left(\begin{array}{c}u\\h\end{array}\right)
			\end{equation*}
			%
			and $\bf C$ is a $2\times2$ matrix:
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\bm C=\left(\begin{array}{cc}U & g\\H &U\end{array}\right)

	\frametitle{Systems of equations: stability}
	%
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Considering a harmonic shape for the solution,
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\bm v_k = \left(\begin{array}{c} u_k \\ h_k\end{array}\right)e^{ikx},
			\end{equation*}
			%
			the time evolution can be written as
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\bm v_k^{n+1}=\bm A_k \bm v_k^n
			\end{equation*}
			%
			with $\bm A_k$ the \emph{amplification matrix}.\vspace*{2ex}
			%
		\item A definition of stability (analogous to oscillation equation) is then:
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\| {\bm v}_k^n \|  =  \| {\bm A}_k^n {\bm v}_k^0 \|  \le   \| {\bm v}_k^0 \|
			\end{equation*}
			%
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\begin{frame}
	%
	\frametitle{Systems of equations: stability}
	%
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Given the property that $\| {\bm A}_k^n \| \le \| {\bm A}_k \|^n$, a sufficient condition for stability is
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\| {\bm A}_k \| \le 1
			\end{equation*}\vspace*{2ex}
			%
		\item This is a sufficient condition, but not a necessary one (see \emph{Durran} for an example).\vspace*{2ex}
			%
		\item Different matrix norms can be defined; the most common is the maximal eigenvalue:
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\|\bm A\| = \max \left| \text{eig} (\bm A) \right|
			\end{equation*}
			%

\begin{frame}
	%
	\frametitle{Systems of equations: dispersion relation}
	%
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Like for the advection equation, a more powerful tool is the discrete dispersion relation.
		\item The dispersion relation is retrieved by assuming discretized harmonic waves (in space \emph{and} time) for $u$ and $h$
			%
			\begin{align*}
				u_j^n&=\hat u e^{i\left(k j \Delta x- \omega n \Delta t\right)}	\\
				h_j^n&=\hat h e^{i\left(k j \Delta x- \omega n \Delta t\right)}
			\end{align*}
			%
		\item For example, considering leapfrog time discretization and centered spatial differences, the SWE become
			%
			\begin{align*}
					\left(-\frac{\sin \omega \Delta t}{\Delta t} + U\frac{\sin k \Delta x}{\Delta x}\right) \hat u	+	g \frac{\sin k \Delta x}{\Delta x}\hat h	&	= 0	\\
					H \frac{\sin k \Delta x}{\Delta x}\hat u + \left(-\frac{\sin \omega \Delta t}{\Delta t} + U\frac{\sin k \Delta x}{\Delta x}\right) \hat h	&	= 0	\\
			\end{align*}
			%
			This homogeneous system only has a nontrivial (i.e. nonzero) solution if its determinant is zero.
	\end{itemize}

%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\begin{frame}
	%
	\frametitle{Systems of equations: dispersion relation}
	%
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The determinant is zero if
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\left(-\frac{\sin \omega \Delta t}{\Delta t} + U\frac{\sin k \Delta x}{\Delta x}\right)^2-gh\left(\frac{\sin k \Delta x}{\Delta x}\right)^2=0
			\end{equation*} 
			%
			or, with $c=\sqrt{gH}$
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\sin\omega \Delta t=\frac{(U\pm c)\Delta t}{\Delta x}\sin k \Delta x
			\end{equation*}\vspace*{2ex}
			%
		\item This is the \emph{dispersion relation} of the SWE for this discretization. It should be compared with the exact dispersion relation for the SWE:
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\omega=(U\pm c) k
			\end{equation*}
			%

			%
		\item Note that the stability condition can be derived from the dispersion analysis, by requiring that $\omega$ is real:
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\left |\frac{(U\pm c)\Delta t}{\Delta x} \right| \leq 1
			\end{equation*}

	\frametitle{Systems of equations: Staggering}
	%
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It is not strictly necessary to define all dependent variables in the same gridpoints.\vspace*{2ex}
			%
		\item E.g. for the linearized 1D shallow water equations you can define $u$ and $h$ at different gridpoints:
			%
			\par\vspace*{1ex}
			Not staggered:
			%
			\begin{center}\begin{tikzpicture}[fill=white,>=latex]
				\draw (-2,0);
				\draw (0,0) -- (4,0);
				\draw plot[mark=square*] (0,0) node[below=2pt] {$u_{j-1}$, $h_{j-1}$} ;
				\draw plot[mark=square*] (2,0) node[below=2pt] {$u_{j}$, $h_{j}$};
				\draw plot[mark=square*] (4,0) node[below=2pt] {$u_{j+1}$, $h_{j+1}$};
			\end{tikzpicture}\end{center}
			%
			\vspace*{1ex}
			%
			Staggered:
			\begin{center}\begin{tikzpicture}[fill=white,>=latex]
				\draw (-2,0);
				\draw (0,0) -- (4,0);
				\draw plot[mark=square*] (0,0) node[below=2pt] {$u_{j-1}$} ;
				\draw plot[mark=diamond*] (1,0) node[below=2pt] {$h_{j-\ft12}$} ;
				\draw plot[mark=square*] (2,0) node[below=2pt] {$u_{j}$};
				\draw plot[mark=diamond*] (3,0) node[below=2pt] {$h_{j+\ft12}$};
				\draw plot[mark=square*] (4,0) node[below=2pt] {$u_{j+1}$};
			\end{tikzpicture}\end{center}\vspace*{2ex}
			%
		\item Advantage: spatial derivatives are calculated over a smaller grid distance (hence more accurate):
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\left.\frac{\partial h}{\partial x}\right|_j\approx\frac{h_{j+\ft12}-h_{j-\ft12}}{\Delta x}

			\begin{equation*}
				\phi^j_{m,n}=e^{i(km\Delta x+\ell n \Delta y-\omega j \Delta t)}

			%
			For the space-centered leapfrog scheme and $\Delta x =\Delta y=\Delta s$, this yields:
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				(|U|+|V|)\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta s} < 1
			\end{equation*}
			%
			or, if $C$ is the maximum speed in the domain,
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				C\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta s} < \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
			\end{equation*}

			So a wave with wavelength $2\Delta s$ in the $x$-direction and $2\Delta s$ in the $y$-direction has a wavelength $\sqrt{2}\Delta s$ along the first bisector.

			\begin{equation*}
				\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} K \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}
			\end{equation*}
			%
			with $K > 0$.\vspace*{2ex}

		\item Let us discretize with a forward-time, centered-space scheme:
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\frac{\phi^{n+1}_j - \phi^n_j}{\Delta t} = K\delta_x^2\phi^n_j
			\end{equation*}
			%
			where $\delta_x^2\phi_j=\frac{\phi_{j+1} - 2 \, \phi_j + \phi_{j-1}}{\Delta x^2}$
			%
		\item Von Neuman stability analysis shows that the amplification factor is
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				A_k = 1 - 2 \nu \left(
					1 - \cos k \Delta x
				\right)
			\end{equation*}
			%
			with
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\nu = \frac{K \Delta t}{\Delta x^2}

			%

				0 < \nu \le \ft12
			\end{equation*}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Note that due to the form of $\nu = \frac{K \Delta t}{\Delta x^2}$ this scheme does not stay stable when $\Delta t, \Delta x \rightarrow 0$
	unless $\Delta t$ decreases much more rapidly than $\Delta x$!\vspace*{2ex}
			%
		\item This makes this scheme very inefficient at high resolutions!

		\end{equation*}
		%
		the amplification factor becomes

		\begin{equation*}
			A_k = \frac{1 - \nu \left( 1 - \cos k \Delta x \right)}	{1 + \nu \left( 1 - \cos k \Delta x \right)}

			\begin{equation*}
				\left(\begin{array}{ccccc}

					\cdots & 1+\nu &-\nu/2 & 0 & \cdots \\
					\cdots & -\nu/2 & 1+\nu & -\nu/2 & \cdots \\

		\item (The barotropic vorticity equation)\vspace*{2ex}

\begin{frame}

	\frametitle{Variable advection speed: aliasing}
	%
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We consider the 1D advection equation with variable wind $c(x)$,
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} + c(x) \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} = 0
			\end{equation*}
			%
		\item Let us consider a discretization on $N$ gridpoints on a domain $[0,2\pi)$. Suppose that the wind $c(x)$ and the initial state $\psi(t=0)$ are composed of waves with wavenumbers $0$, $N/4$ and $N/2$ (i.e. wavelengths $\infty$, $4\Delta x$ and $2\Delta x$):
			%
			\begin{align*}
				c(x_j) &= c_0 + (c_r+ic_i) e^{i \pi j/2} + (c_r-ic_i) e^{-i \pi j/2} + c_n e^{i \pi j} \\
				\phi(x_j) &= a_0 + (a_r+ia_i) e^{i \pi j/2} + (a_r-ia_i) e^{-i \pi j/2} + a_n e^{i \pi j}
			\end{align*}
			%
		\item We may expect aliasing, e.g.
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				e^{i \pi j /2} e^{i \pi j} = e^{i 3 \pi j /2} = e^{- i \pi j/2}
			\end{equation*}
			%
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\begin{frame}
	%
	\frametitle{Variable advection speed: aliasing}
	%
	\begin{itemize}
		\item One can show that with centered spatial differences, the exact time evolution of the spectral coefficients $a_0$, $a_r$, $a_i$, $a_n$ is given by:
			%
			\begin{align*}
				\frac{d a_0}{dt} &= 2 \frac{a_i c_r - a_r c_i}{\Delta x}	&
				\frac{d a_n}{dt} &= 2 \frac{a_i c_r + a_r c_i}{\Delta x}	\\
				\frac{d a_r}{dt} &= a_i \frac{c_n + c_0}{\Delta x}	&
				\frac{d a_i}{dt} &= a_r \frac{c_n - c_0}{\Delta x}
			\end{align*}
			%
		\item Eliminating $a_i$, we find for the time evolution of $a_r$:
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\frac{d^2 a_r}{dt^2} = \frac{c_n^2 - c_0^2}{\Delta x^2} a_r
			\end{equation*}
			%
			which has an exponential solution!
			%
		\item So with this discretization, we get an instability if $c_n > c_0$, regardless of the time discretization!.
			%
		\item This growth is unphysical since the solution is bounded by the maximum value of $\psi$.

	\frametitle{Burger's equation}

			%
			\begin{equation*}
			 \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} + \psi \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} = 0
			\end{equation*}
			%
		\item If the initial condition is $\psi(x,t=0)=f(x)$, then the solution can be written implicitly as
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\psi(x,t) = f ( x - \psi(x,t) t)
			\end{equation*}
			%
			So $\psi$ is constant along the so-called \emph{characteristic curves} in the $(x,t)$ plane:
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				x - \psi(x,t) t = cst.

	\begin{itemize}

		\item We can try a different shape (`flux-shape') of Burger's equation:
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial \psi^2}{\partial x} = 0
			\end{equation*}
			%
			which is discretized as:
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\frac{d \phi_j}{dt}  + \ft12 \frac{\phi_{j+1}^2 - \phi_{j-1}^2}{2 \Delta x} = 0
			\end{equation*}
			%
		\item This leads to
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\frac{d}{dt} \sum_j \phi_j^2 =-\ft12	\sum_j \phi_j \phi_{j+1}\frac{\phi_{j+1} - \phi_j}{\Delta x}	\ne 0
			\end{equation*}
			%
			so it doesn't conserve the norm either.

			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\frac{d \phi_j}{dt}  + \ft23 \frac{\phi_{j+1}^2 - \phi_{j-1}^2}{2 \Delta x}  +\ft13 \frac{\phi_{j+1} - \phi_{j-1}}{2 \Delta x} \phi_j = 0
			\end{equation*}
			%
		\item The contributions of both schemes to the norm evolution will cancel out, so this scheme conserves the norm
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\frac{d}{dt} \sum_j \phi_j^2 = 0
			\end{equation*}
			%
			and doesn't blow up.

		\item In reality there is always some diffusion
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} + \psi \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} = \nu \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2}
			\end{equation*}\vspace*{2ex}
			%
		\item Then the true solution never develops a shock. However, if discretized with the advective form, a scheme can develop a shock for sufficiently small values of $\nu$.\vspace*{2ex}

		\item This is another reason for introducing some dosis of (artificial) numerical diffusion.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item The barotropic vorticity equation (see \emph{Dynamic Meteorology}) is written as:
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\frac{\partial \zeta}{\partial t} + \bm u \cdot \nabla \zeta = 0
			\end{equation*}
			%
			with $\bm u$ the geostrophic wind\vspace*{-1mm}
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\bm u = \bm k \times \nabla \psi
			\end{equation*}
			%
			and the vorticity\vspace*{-1mm}
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\zeta = \bm k \cdot \nabla \times \bm u =\nabla^2\psi
			\end{equation*}
			%
		\item Although this a nonlinear equation, one can show that there is no \emph{net} energy transfer between scales (the average wavenumber is conserved).
			%
		\item Here too, a clever discretization satisfies this conservation constraint, and allows to suppress the nonlinear instability.

			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = - \left( K \psi^P \right) \psi + S
			\end{equation*}

			with $K$ a constant representing the amount of damping, and $P$ the degree of nonlinearity. $S$ is an external forcing.\vspace*{2ex}

		\item This equation has been studied by Kalnay and Kanamitsu (1988) (Mon. Wea. Rev., 116, 1945-1958) and is considered as the reference test for diffusion schemes in atmospheric models.

			\begin{itemize}
				\item Stability and dispersion for systems of equations is (almost) the same as for scalar equations, with matrices replacing scalars.\vspace*{1ex}
				\item Aliasing is closely related to nonlinearity\vspace*{1ex}
				\item Barotropic vorticity equation $\Leftarrow$ \emph{Dynamic Meteorology}\vspace*{1ex}
				\item Diffusion equation $\Leftarrow$ \emph{Physical Meteorology}
			\end{itemize}\vspace*{2ex}
		\item Methodology is more important than algebra! Think in terms of waves\ldots\vspace*{2ex}
		\item This course is about \emph{surprising} results due to numerical discretization.\vspace*{1ex}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item stability in 2D is more stringent than in 1D\vspace*{1ex}
				\item even for the diffusion equation, unstable behaviour may occur\vspace*{1ex}
				\item nonlinearity may lead to instability, even with supposedly stable schemes.\vspace*{1ex}
				\item \ldots\vspace*{2ex}
