1D Shallow Water Equations
==========================

This program models the linearized 1D SWE, defined as

   du/dt + UM du/dx +  g dh/dx = 0
   dh/dt + HM du/dx + UM dh/dx = 0

where UM and HM are the constant background horizontal speed and the water height, 
u and h are the perturbations on the horizontal speed and the water height.
g is the gravitational acceleration.

This program uses leapfrog time integration, centered second-order space differencing,
and periodic boundary conditions.


Prerequisites
-------------

This program supposes you are working on a Linux system, with the gfortran fortran
compiler installed. Visualization is done in R (or RStudio).


Installation and compilation
----------------------------

First, unpack the file swe1D.tgz with the command 
		
		tar -zxvf swe1D.tgz

Go to the directory with
		
		cd swe1D

Then compile the program with the command
		
		make swe1D
		
If you have a nonstandard linux installation, make the necessary modifications in the file Makefile.


Use
---

First, set the parameters values the file fort.4.
Then, run the program with the command "./swe1D".
Finally, animate the results in R(Studio) with the commands

	source('show.R')
	showResults('output.dat',freq=10)

The fish indicates the constant advection.

To plot a single timestep (e.g. the 20th), use
	showResults('output.dat',timestep=20)
	

Changing the program
--------------------

If you make modifications to the parameter values in the file fort.4, you don't have to recompile the program.
If you make changes to any of the Fortran  (*.F90) files, you should recompile with the command "make swe1D".
