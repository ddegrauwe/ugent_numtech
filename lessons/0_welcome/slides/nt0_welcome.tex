	%
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Get hold of problems that occur due to solving equations numerically (with a computer)\\[3ex]
\pause
		\item Distinguish these problems from other aspects of modeling
		\item Develop knowledge of existing solutions to these problems
		\item Be able to communicate with numerical analyst\\[3ex]
\pause
		\item Don't be frightened by code\\ \quad\ldots but it's no course on programming either!

	\frametitle{Relation to AI-driven models}
	%
	\begin{itemize}
		\item AI-driven weather models are performing better and better, sometimes beating physics-based models on specific scores, often at a fraction of the computational cost\\[3ex]
		\item \emph{[personal assessment!]} This will make physics-based models less and less relevant, especially for operational weather forecasting\\[3ex]
		\item Nevertheless,\\[1ex]
		    \begin{itemize}
		        \item Physics-based models remain (for now) important for training AI models\\[1ex]
		        \item There is value in scientific understanding\\[1ex]
		        \item Many aspects treated in this course are also relevant for AI models, e.g. time-stepping, stability, scalability, etc.
