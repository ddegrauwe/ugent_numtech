		\item Meteorological fields (temperature, wind, pressure, humidity, \ldots) are continuous in time and space.
		\item On a computer you cannot represent a continuous field; you would need an infinity of points.
		\item So a field will be \emph{discretized}, i.e. it is represented by the values in a set of discrete points:\\[2mm]

	\begin{itemize}
			%
		\item Many physical laws are differential equations\vspace*{2ex}
			%
		\item Some definition of the derivative in $x$:
			\begin{align*}
				\frac{df}{dx} (x_0) &= \lim_{\delta x \rightarrow 0}%
					\frac{f(x_0+\delta x) - f(x_0)}{\delta x}
				\\
				\frac{df}{dx} (x_0) &= \lim_{\delta x \rightarrow 0}%
					\frac{f(x_0) - f(x_0-\delta x)}{\delta x}
				\\
				\frac{df}{dx} (x_0) &= \lim_{\delta x \rightarrow 0}%
					\frac{f(x_0+\delta x) - f(x_0 - \delta x)}{2 \delta x}
				\end{align*}\vspace*{2ex}
			%
		\item On our discrete grid we can't take the limit $\delta x \rightarrow 0$, so the derivative is computed with a finite value $\delta x \rightarrow \Delta x$ (i.e. the grid distance).

	\frametitle{The upstream scheme}

	Let us call $\phi_j^n$ the solution of the discretized system at time $n \Delta t$ and at grid point $j \Delta x$.\vspace*{2ex}
	%
	\par
	We replace the derivatives by,\vspace*{2ex}
	%
	\begin{align*}
		\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} &\rightarrow \frac{\phi_j^{n+1} - \phi_j^n}{\Delta t}\\
		\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} &\rightarrow  \frac{\phi_j^n - \phi_{j-1}^n}{\Delta x}
	\end{align*}\par\vspace*{2ex}
	%
	in the advection equation:\vspace*{2ex}
	%
	\begin{equation*}
		\frac{\phi_j^{n+1} - \phi_j^n}{\Delta t}
		+ c \frac{\phi_j^n - \phi_{j-1}^n}{\Delta x} = 0
	\end{equation*}\par\vspace*{2ex}
	%
	This is called the \emph{upstream scheme}.
\end{frame}
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\begin{frame}
	%
	\frametitle{The upstream scheme}
	%
	This equation can be solved w.r.t. $\phi_j^{n+1}$:\vspace*{2ex}
	%
	\begin{equation*}
		\phi_j^{n+1} = (1-\mu) \phi_j^n + \mu \phi_{j-1}^n
	\end{equation*}\par\vspace*{2ex}
	%
	with $\mu = c \Delta t / \Delta x$.
	%

	\begin{equation*}
		f(x_0+\Delta x) = f(x_0) +

	%
	the error in the approximation of the derivative is\vspace*{2ex}
	%
	\begin{equation*}
		\frac{f(x_0+\Delta x) - f(x_0)}{\Delta x}
		- \frac{d f}{dx} (x_0) =
		\frac{\textcolor{green!60!black}{\Delta x}}{2} \frac{d^2 f}{dx^2} (x_0)
		+ \frac{\Delta x^2}{6} \frac{d^3 f}{dx^3} (x_0) + \dots
	\end{equation*}\par\vspace*{2ex}
	%
	The leading term is proportional to $\Delta x$, so this is called a first-order accurate method.\vspace*{2ex}

	Considering the centered finite-difference approximation
	\begin{equation*}
		\frac{f(x_0+\Delta x) - f(x_0 - \Delta x)}{2 \Delta x}

		\frac{\textcolor{green!60!black}{\Delta x^2}}{6} \frac{d^3 f}{dx^3} (x_0) +
		\frac{\Delta x^4}{120} \frac{d^5 f}{dx^5} (x_0) + \dots
	\end{equation*}\par\vspace*{2ex}

	\frametitle{Higher-order accuracy}
	%
	By using more information (more gridpoints), it is possible to obtain a more accurate approximation for the derivative:\vspace*{3ex}
	%
	\begin{align*}
		\frac{df}{dx} (x_0) = &
		\frac43 \left(
			\frac{f(x_0 + \Delta x) - f(x_0 - \Delta x)}{2 \Delta x}
		\right)\\
		&-\frac13 \left(
			\frac{f(x_0 + 2\Delta x) - f(x_0 - 2 \Delta x)}{4 \Delta x}
		\right)
		+ O[\Delta x^4 ]

%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\begin{frame}
	%
	\frametitle{Consistency}
	%
	A scheme is called \emph{consistent} if the truncation error converges to zero when $\Delta x \rightarrow 0$ and $\Delta t \rightarrow 0$.
	%
	\par\vspace*{3ex}
	For example, the truncation error for the upstream scheme is:\vspace*{2ex}
	%
	\begin{equation*}
		\frac{\psi_j^{n+1} - \psi_j^n}{\Delta t}
		+ c \frac{\psi_j^n - \psi_{j-1}^n}{\Delta x} = 
		\frac{\Delta t}{2} \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial t^2}
		- c \frac{\Delta x}{2} \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2} + \dots
	\end{equation*}\par\vspace*{2ex}
	%
	where $\psi$ denotes the exact solution.
	%
\end{frame}
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\begin{frame}
	%
	\frametitle{Convergence}
	%
	A finite-difference scheme is called \emph{convergent} of order $(p,q)$\\ if in the limit $\Delta t, \Delta x \rightarrow 0$, the numerical solution $\phi_j^n$ satisfies\vspace*{4ex}
	%
	\begin{equation*}
	\| \psi (n \Delta t, j \Delta x ) - \phi_j^n \| = O [ \Delta t^p ] + O [ \Delta x^q ]
	\end{equation*}
	%
\end{frame}
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\begin{frame}
	%
	\frametitle{Convergence vs. consistence}
	%
	Consistency tells you something about the equations, convergence tells you about the solution.
	%
	\par\vspace*{3ex}
	The upstream scheme example shows that these two are not identical: it is consistent but not convergent.
	%
	\par\vspace*{3ex}
	There's a problem with the usability of convergence: it relies on the exact solution, which is unknown in most cases.
	%
\end{frame}
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\begin{frame}
	%
	\frametitle{Lax theorem}
	%
	The Lax equivalence theorem says that:\\
	%
	\begin{center}
		\bfseries
		If a finite-difference scheme is {linear}, {stable}, and {consistent},\\
		then it is {convergent}
	\end{center}
	%
\pause
	\par\vspace*{4ex}
	Importance: \parbox[t]{.6\textwidth}{in practice we never know the true solution, but we can check if the scheme is \emph{consistent} and \emph{stable}.}
	%
	\par\vspace*{3ex}
	But when is a scheme stable?
	%
\end{frame}
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\begin{frame}
	%
	\frametitle{Numerical stability}
	%
	A sufficient condition for stability is that\vspace*{2ex}
	%
	\begin{equation*}
		\| \phi^n \| \le \| \phi^0 \| \quad \text{for all timesteps} \quad n>0
	\end{equation*}\par\vspace*{5ex}
	%
	Again, we don't need to know the true solution for this!
	%
\end{frame}
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\begin{frame}
	%
	\frametitle{Checking stability}
	%
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It is difficult to check the evolution of $\| \phi^n \|$ in general.\vspace*{2ex}
			%
		\item Von Neumann proposed to check stability by considering harmonic functions:
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\phi(x)=\exp(ik x)=\cos(kx)+i\sin(kx)
			\end{equation*}
			%
			\begin{center}
				\bfseries
				If a scheme is stable for all harmonic functions (i.e. all values of $k$),\\ then it is also stable for all (non-harmonic) functions.
			\end{center}\vspace*{2ex}
			%
		\item Because harmonic functions are eigenfunctions of the differential operator, one can express their time evolution as a multiplication with an \emph{amplification factor} $A_k$:
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\phi^{n}=A_k\phi^{n-1}=\left(A_k\right)^n\phi^0
			\end{equation*}\par\vspace*{2ex}
			%
		\item So stability requires $\|A_k\|\leq 1$, for all $k$.
			%
	\end{itemize}
	%
\end{frame}
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\begin{frame}
	%
	\frametitle{Example: stability of the upstream scheme}
	%
	Let us consider again the upstream scheme for the advection equation:
	%
	\begin{equation*}
		\phi_j^{n+1} = (1-\mu) \phi_j^n + \mu \phi_{j-1}^n
	\end{equation*}
	%
	with $\mu = c \Delta t / \Delta x$.
	%
	\par\vspace*{6ex}
	\textbf{What is the amplification factor?}
	%
\pause
	\par\vspace*{4ex}
	First, assume that $\phi_j^n=(A_k)^ne^{ikj\Delta x}$, so\vspace*{2ex}
	%
	\begin{equation*}
		(A_k)^{n+1} e^{ik j \Delta x} = (A_k)^{n}(1-\mu )e^{ikj \Delta x}
		+ (A_k)^{n}\mu e^{ik(j-1) \Delta x}
	\end{equation*}
	%
\pause
	The amplification factor $A_k$ then becomes
	%
	\begin{align*}
		A_k &= 1 -\mu +\mu e^{-ik \Delta x}	\\
			&=(1-\mu+\mu\cos k\Delta x) - i \mu\sin k\Delta x
	\end{align*}

	%
	\frametitle{Example: stability of the upstream scheme}
	%
	\textbf{Is the amplification factor smaller than 1?}
	%
\pause
\par\vspace*{2ex}
	The modulus of the complex number $A_k$ is given by
	%
	\begin{equation*}
		| A_k |^2 = 1 - 2 \mu \left( 1 -\mu \right) \left( 1 - \cos k \Delta x \right)
	\end{equation*}
	%
\pause
	\par\vspace*{2ex}
	This will be $\le 1$ for all values of $k$ if
	%
	\begin{equation*}
		\mu \left( 1 - \mu \right) \ge 0
	\end{equation*}
	%
	i.e. if
	%
	\begin{equation*}
		0 \le \frac{c \Delta t }{\Delta x} \le 1

	\frametitle{Example: stability of the upstream scheme}
	%
	\begin{itemize}
		\item So the upstream scheme is \emph{conditionally stable}, i.e. stability depends on the values of $c$, $\Delta x$ and $\Delta t$.\\[4ex]
		\item In general,
			%
			\begin{itemize}
				\item higher spatial resolution is less stable
				\item smaller timesteps is more stable
				\item higher velocity is less stable\\[4ex]
			\end{itemize}
		\item $\mu=\frac{c \Delta t }{\Delta x}$ is called the Courant number.\\[4ex]
		\item The condition $\mu\leq 1$ is called the Courant-Fredrichs-Lewy (CFL) criterion.
