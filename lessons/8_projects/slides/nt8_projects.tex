	General remarks:
	%
	\begin{myitemize}{1ex}
		\item no course on Python; no course on complex algebra;\\ask for help!
		\item open assignment: no exact solution $+$ discussion is more important than results
		\item the purpose is you \emph{learn} something
		\item try to trigger strange/unwanted phenomena, and discuss solutions.
		\item you can propose a topic yourself.

	The linearized 1D shallow water equations (SWE) are given by:
	%
	\begin{align*}
		\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+U\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+g\frac{\partial h}{\partial x}&=0\\
		\frac{\partial h}{\partial t}+H\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+U\frac{\partial h}{\partial x}&=0
	\end{align*}
	%
	where $g$ is gravity, $U$ and $H$ are the constant basic-state velocity and water height, and $u(x,t)$ and $h(x,t)$ are the perturbations on the velocity and the water height.

		\item The barotropic vorticity equation BVE is given by:
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\frac{\partial \zeta}{\partial t}+\bm u\cdot\nabla\zeta=0
			\end{equation*}
			%
			where $\zeta$ is the vorticity, and $\bm u$ is the geostrophic wind, given by
			%
			\begin{align*}
				\bm u&=\bm k\times\nabla\psi		&		\nabla^2\psi&=\zeta
			\end{align*}
			%
		\item Writing everything in terms of the streamfunction $\psi$, the BVE becomes
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				\frac{\partial\nabla^2\psi}{\partial t}+J(\psi,\nabla^2\psi)=0
			\end{equation*}
			%
			where $J$ is the Jacobian operator:
			%
			\begin{equation*}
				J(p,q)=\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\frac{\partial q}{\partial y}-\frac{\partial p}{\partial y}\frac{\partial q}{\partial x}

	\frametitle{Original model}
	%
	The original (1950) model is characterized by:
	%
	\begin{myitemize}{1ex}
		\item a leapfrog time integration
			%
		\item second-order centered space differences
			%
		\item an expensive (pseudo-spectral) way to invert the Laplacian operator
			%
		\item heuristic boundary conditions:
			%
			\begin{myitemize}{1ex}
				\item $\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}=0$ on boundary
				\item $\frac{\partial \nabla^2 \psi}{\partial t}=0$ for entering fluid
			\end{myitemize}
			%
	\end{myitemize}
	Due to these boundary conditions and aliasing, the model is not stable.
	%
	\par\vspace*{4ex}
	The student's model is somewhat simplified:
	%
	\begin{myitemize}{1ex}
		\item Spectral inversion of Laplacian
		\item Periodic boundary conditions
		\item Coriolis effect removed
		\item Projection impact removed
	\end{myitemize}
